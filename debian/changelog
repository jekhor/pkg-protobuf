protobuf (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version
  * Fix "Please split out libprotoc.so.N out of the libprotobufN
    package" (Closes: #524087)
  * Update Standards Version to 3.8.2 (no changes needed, sections are already
    correct and the rest doesn't affect this package)

protobuf (2.0.3-2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix FTBFS from -2.1: don't fail when we can't clean up the java build,
    such as when openjdk isn't installed.
  * Disable parallel builds, because libtool is made of fail (if binary-arch
    and build-indep run concurrently, we relink a library while it's being
    used; that doesn't work so well).

protobuf (2.0.3-2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium urgency for RC bugfix.
  * Fix building of test suites on ia64: use __clone2() instead of clone(),
    which doesn't exist there (closes: #530606).  Patch by Sune Vuorela.
  * Only build the java and python bindings when building the arch:all
    packages.  Move openjdk to Build-Depends-Indep.  This should allow
    building on hppa, which doesn't have openjdk.  Based on a patch by Sune
    Vuorela (but any bugs are mine).

protobuf (2.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the binary-arch/binary-common interaction by only calling
    dh_pysupport when we are in arch-independent mode (DH_OPTIONS=-i)
  * Remove the extraneous conflicts/replace with libprotobuf2/libprotobuf0
    from libprotobuf3, as they share no files (and have different SONAMES)
    (Closes: #523992)
